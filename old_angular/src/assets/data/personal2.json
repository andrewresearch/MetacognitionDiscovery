Eyes are scratchy, and there is another day of computer screens ahead of me as I write more content for the digital learning module. Children have been unwell through nights, and this has also contributed to tiredness. However, I have just finished a skype session with the A team, and feel energised by the ideas, enthusiasm, and support we have built. The connection with family wellness, work wellness, and sustaining one another in contributing to our collective career trajectories is very encouraging. I have also been energized by the positive way that people have responded to requests to be filmed, and how these conversations on youtube reflect the voices of people living daily lives of integrity. I have really let go of the string of time. That is a balloon that can float up in the sky all by itself and I won't cry, but just enjoy the sight. I am doing what I can, as I can and that is ok."
